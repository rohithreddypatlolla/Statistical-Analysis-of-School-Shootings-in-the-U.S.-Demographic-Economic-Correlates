# Statistical Analysis of School-Shootings in the U.S.-Demographic-Economic-Correlates
GIS-based analysis exploring relationships between U.S. school shootings and socio-economic factors like population density, unemployment, and student enrollment. Used ArcGIS Pro for spatial joins, buffer, and hotspot analysis. Findings show no single factor predicts incidentsâ€”multiple variables influence outcomes.
